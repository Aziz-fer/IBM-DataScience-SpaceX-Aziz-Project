# IBM-DataScience-SpaceX-Aziz-Project
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.
# Objectives
- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data
 
- Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia
- Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame
  
- Perform exploratory  Data Analysis and determine Training Labels
- Understand the Spacex DataSet
  
- Load the dataset  into the corresponding table in a Db2 database
- Execute SQL queries to answer assignment questions
  
- PreparingÂ Data Feature Engineering
- Mark all launch sites on a map with Folium
- Mark the success/failed launches for each site on the map
- Calculate the distances between a launch site to its proximities

- We use an Interactive Visual Analytics with Plotly

- Create a column for the class
- Standardize the data
- Split into training data and test data
- Find best Hyperparameter for SVM, Classification Trees and Logistic Regression
